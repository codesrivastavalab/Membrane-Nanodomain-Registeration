# MEMBRANE BIOPHYSICS TUTORIAL
## AA-Artificial-Lipid-Bilayer-Tutorial

This tutorial will guide a new user through the process of setting up a simulation system
containing a symmetric multi-component lipid bilayer membrane in a box of water.

This tutorial assumes you are using a GROMACS version in the 2018.x series.

**Please note** that the purpose of this tutorial is instructional and is not an endorsement
or suggestion that you use these specific parameters/procedure for your simulation.

If you have suggestions for improving this tutorial, if you notice a mistake, or if anything is otherwise unclear, please feel free to [email me](mailto:aniruddha.seal@niser.ac.in). Please note: this is not an invitation to email me for CHARMM-GUI, GROMACS or Membrane Biophysics problems. I do not advertise myself as a private tutor or personal help service.
